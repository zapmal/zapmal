## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Manuel, I'm a final year Computer Science student who also works as full-stack.

I like solving exciting and â€”sometimesâ€” complex problems. I enjoy learning, be it new or old principles and technologies that I can apply in building new, usable software. I feel more engaged when working on something that can't be solved by merely searching the web or reading a book. Often the ambiguity of those problems is enjoyable. It's always great when I can collaborate with a team of like-minded engineers.

Currently, I'm learning Cloud Computing and RTC, coupled with other things that I'm interested in learning in depth.
